# frozen_string_literal: true
# Jtech sub-plugin: Mod elections — the forum elects its moderators.
#
# On a calendar (every January, April, July and October by default)
# nominations open, then Vote Week, then an admin publishes the count.
# Members rank the candidates; the count is single transferable vote
# (lib/discourse_mod_elections/stv.rb) with each ballot weighted by its
# voter's trust level when nominations opened. Admins never run or vote.
# Publishing makes the winners moderators and takes moderator rights from
# the sitting moderators who weren't elected; former moderators keep trust
# level 4, locked, until they lose re-election too often.
